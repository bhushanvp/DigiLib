                            <h2>China Room</h2>
                        </a>
                        <h3>Sunjeev Sahota</h3>A multigenerational novel of love, oppression, trauma and the pursuit of
                        freedom, inspired in part by the author's own family history, China Room twines together the
                        stories of a woman and a man separated by more than half a century but united by blood.

                        Mehar, a young bride in the rural Punjab of 1929, is trying to discover the identity of her new
                        husband. She and her sisters-in-law, married to three brothers in a single ceremony, spend their
                        days hard at work in the family's 'china room', sequestered from contact with the men. When
                        Mehar develops a theory as to which of them is hers, a passion is ignited that puts more than
                        one life at risk.

                        Spiralling around Mehar's story is that of a young man who, in 1999, travels from England to the
                        now-deserted farm, its 'china room' locked and barred. In enforced flight from the traumas of
                        his adolescence-his experiences of addiction, racism and estrangement from the culture of his
                        birth-he spends a summer in painful contemplation and recovery, before finally finding the
                        strength to return home.

                        <h3>Sanjena Sathian</h3>A profoundly intelligent and bitingly funny exploration of identity and
                        coming of age, Sanjena Sathian's debut novel Gold Diggers marks the arrival of a major talent.

                        A floundering teenager growing up in Atlanta's suburbs, Neil Narayan doesn't have the same drive
                        as everyone around him. His immigrant parents' expectations for him are high, and he tries to
                        want their version of success, but mostly, Neil just wants his neighbour Anita Dayal.

                        But Anita has a secret: she and her mother, Anjali, have been brewing an ancient alchemical
                        potion from stolen gold that transfers the ambition of the jewellery's original owner to the
                        drinker. Anita needs just a little boost to get into Harvard, but when Neil - who needs a whole
                        lot more - joins in the plot, events spiral into a tragedy that rips their community apart.

                        Spanning two continents, two coasts, and four epochs, Gold Diggers expertly balances social
                        satire and magical realism, asking what a community must do to achieve the American dream.

                        <h3>Ravinder Singh</h3>The blue-eyed boy of Indian publishing, Abhimanyu Razdan is known for his
                        bestselling romances, which move his readers to tears. PaperInk, an up-and-coming publishing
                        house, is looking for an A-list author who will take them to the next level.

                        So, when Abhimanyu's contract with his current publishers comes to an end, PaperInk decides to
                        swoop in. But Abhimanyu isn't quite like the emotional and sensitive characters in the novels he
                        writes. Callous, egoistic and drunk on success, he gets into a hot argument with Asmita,
                        PaperInk's literary fiction editor, even before his first meeting with them. Already put off,
                        despite her apology, he is even more incensed when he discovers that Asmita looks down on
                        popular fiction, especially the kind he writes. He vows to teach her a lesson that could
                        jeopardize her job.

                        At each other's throats, Abhimanyu and Asmita are as different as can be, but fate has something
                        else in store and they soon find that there is no running away from love.

                        <h3>Carys Davies</h3>Fleeing the dark undercurrents of contemporary life in Britain, Hilary byrd
                        takes refuge in Ooty, a Hill station in South India. There he finds solace in life's simple
                        pleasures, travelling by rickshaw around the small town with his driver jamshed and staying in a
                        mission house beside the local presbytery where the padre and his adoptive daughter Priscilla
                        have taken Hilary under their wing.
                        The padre is concerned for priscilla's future, and as hilary's friendship with theyoung woman
                        grows, he begins to wonder whether his purpose lies in this newrelationship. But religious
                        tensions are brewing and the mission house may not bethe safe haven it seems.
                        The mission house boldly and imaginatively explores post-colonial ideas in a worldfractured
                        between faith and non-belief, young and old, imperial past andnationalistic present. Tenderly
                        subversive and meticulously crafted, it is a deeplyhuman fable of the wonders and terrors of
                        connection in a modern world.

                        <h3>Kashif Mashaikh</h3>For the past three decades, Jeevanram has worked the night shift at the
                        mortuary of the Grand Trunk Hospital in Mumbai. At the sunset of his career, he is joined by a
                        young apprentice who is clearly uncomfortable when confronted by death and disease, and the
                        social apathy that has crept into the system. The apprentice is afraid to face his fears; but
                        through the nine dark tales Jeevanram tells him, the young man begins to understand the purpose
                        of life and death, of love and loss, of loneliness, guilt and everything in between.

                        Drawing from the narrative patterns of Vikram–Betaal and the Arabian Nights, Mortuary Tales is
                        filled with stories of real fear, and the many ghosts that the mind can conjure. An exceptional,
                        compelling debut.

                        <h3>Ravi Shankar Etteth</h3>After thwarting the devious Lord Suma and becoming the emperor of
                        Magadha, Ashoka now faces a new threat—a lethal foe whose only aim is to topple his empire. By
                        slaughtering imperial officials, kidnapping royal prisoners and infiltrating the palace, the
                        nemesis weaves a mesh of hatred, intrigue and menace. His identity is unknown, yet he breathes
                        such terror that even dying men fear to utter his name. He calls himself the Khandapati. He
                        provokes prison riots. He leads the Resistance. A poison witch and a murderous giant terrorise
                        the people. What is the role of the vishkanya Daarya and the Pretnath? Who is the mysterious
                        prisoner named Nirmukh?

                        </a>
                        <h3>Saima Mir</h3>Successful lawyer Jia Khan has built a quiet and solitary life for herself in
                        London, away from her family and the streets of Yorkshire where she grew up. But some truths
                        cannot be wished away.

                        When her father, Akbar Khan, leader of the Pukhtun community and overlord of the local crime
                        syndicate, the Jirga, is found murdered, Jia must leave her carefully constructed life behind
                        and take his place. As she prepares for her new role, Jia has to keep the family together while
                        convincing the all-male Jirga of her worth, combating a particularly ruthless rival and
                        preventing gang wars. Establishing her own brand of justice and honour, Jia must live by the
                        words of her mentor: Be twice as good as men, and four times as good as white men.

                        <h3>Purushottam Agrawal</h3>As the right wing tries to claim Kabir for itself, while other
                        conservatives disown him and yet others portray him as a secular idol beyond religion, the poet
                        has never been so misunderstood. Coming from the Nirgun bhakti tradition, the words of this
                        fifteenth-century poet have the power to reach beyond time and speak to us today. Was he a Hindu
                        or Muslim or was he beyond religion? Did he try to cultivate a new faith or did he eschew
                        organised religion altogether? Was his modernity an exception or a reflection of the times he
                        lived in? What does Kabir’s life and poetry tell us about this nation’s past and present?

                        </a>
                        <h3>S. Prakash</h3>The Spiritual CEO makes a concrete case for running businesses with greater
                        integrity and ethics, and inculcating spiritual values into corporate culture, starting with the
                        CEO and trickling down to every employee in the organisation.

                        Exploring concepts like Korporate Karma, Spiritual Alchemy, Corporate and Spiritual TBL (triple
                        bottom line), Korporate DNA and the positive influence of tradition, values and beliefs on
                        businesses, this book opens our collective eyes to the urgent need for change. It also includes
                        practical solutions and tangible guidance on how a CEO—and indeed every business leader—can
                        adapt to the new world and its reality.
